Right now there are three versions:

1. proposals_tracking_robot.py
This is done without chat gpt's optimizing and just as it is done in my computer at the moment, with:
 - The new_unique_groups thing fixed.
 - A min contour's perimeter to avoid unnecesary loops.
 - A min radius to avoid unnecesary proposals.
It should work but slow

2. proposals_tracking_robot_optimized.py
This version is the chatgpt working proposal to make it more efficient. However, I get some different outputs and I know that some things that I do are missing, so I wouldn't trust this too much. 

3. proposals_tracking_robot_optimized_withmything.py
This version was made based on the first version, proposals_tracking_robot.py, but changing some things (inspired by the second version, proposals_tracking_robot_optimized.py) to make it faster. It should work.


The three of them are tested in a notebook called: proposals_new_version.ipynb
